# Here are a couple of important notes about using random.random() and rounding. (Create this function without using random.randInt() -- we are trying to build that method ourselves for this assignment!)

# random.random() returns a random floating number between 0.000 and 1.000
# random.random() * 50 returns a random floating number between 0.000 and 50.000
# random.random() * 25 + 10 returns a random floating number between 10.000 and 35.000
# round(num) returns the rounded integer value of num
